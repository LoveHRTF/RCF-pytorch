2019 Spring ENGN 2560 Computer Vision Final Project

Group Members: Ziwei Chen, Yang Jiao, Yiming Li

This repository is highly based on [Xuanyi Li](https://github.com/meteorshowers)'s [RCF PyTorch project](https://github.com/meteorshowers/RCF-pytorch). Thanks a lot!

### Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection

}

### Installation

Install <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a>. The code is tested under 0.4.1 GPU version and Python 3.6  on Ubuntu 16.04. There are also some dependencies for a few Python libraries for data processing and visualizations like `cv2` etc. It's highly recommended that you have access to GPUs.

### Usage

#### Data Preparation

For dataset used in this project, please refer to [data_organize.md](data_orgnize.md) 

#### Training

To train a RCF model on BSDS500:

        python train_RCF.py

Or on Brown CCV:

        sbatch train.sh


#### Evaluation

We use [BSDS-500](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html) and its benchmark software for evalutaion. 

Before evaluation, the non-maximum suppression must be perform. Refer to [nms_pipeline](nms_pipeline.md) for detailed instruction.
